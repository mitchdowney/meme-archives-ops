This terminals.json file can be used in Visual Studio Code with the Terminals Manager extension to allow you to open multiple terminals at one time.

This is extra handy if you setup keyboard shortcuts in VS Code to switch to previous/next terminals. (I use ctrl+shift+z and ctrl+shift+x on Mac, and ctrl+alt+z and ctrl+alt+x on Windows).

Extension: fabiospampinato.vscode-terminals

To use the extension, open the terminals.json file (cmd+p on Mac, ctrl+p on Win), then press cmd+shift+p on Mac, ctrl+shift+p on Win, then type Terminals: Run, press enter, and all the terminals defined in the JSON should open automatically.
