# See the meme-archives-api repo for the .env file that is used by Docker Compose
# The meme-archives-ops repo must exist as a sibling to the meme-archives-api and meme-archives-web
# repos for Docker Compose / deployment purposes. The env vars that are set in the
# ../../meme-archives-api/.env file and the ../../meme-archives-web/.env.local file are
# the env vars that will be used within the Docker containers.
